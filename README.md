# Bash Script Project

As part of our Computer Systems module we were asked to create a bash script that allowed a company to store customers details in a file. The brief for the project is below:

  > You have been approached by the owner of a small local company, who requires a Linux based
  > software tool to allow them to keep track of all of their business contacts (i.e.
  > customer details). This tool will serve the purpose similar to that of the Address Book in
  > common email applications.
  > 
  > The owner is particularly interested in keeping track of each customer's name, alias (i.e.
  > nick name) address, telephone number, and email address.
  > Based upon the above information the owner would like to be able to search for particular
  > customer entries, add new customers and remove old customers from the Address Book.
  >
  > This tool should also provide the user with the ability to e-mail any and all of the
  > customers listed in the address book with details of upcoming sales or discount offers.

The project was built and tested in Ubuntu.

## Installation
Clone the project to a directory on a Linux system. Navigate to the directory the project was cloned to. For first time use you will have to enter the following commands: 

```sh
chmod 755 Menu
chmod 755 AddCust
chmod 755 EmailCust
chmod 755 FindCust
chmod 755 RemCust
```
To start the program the following command must be entered:
```sh
./Menu
```

At this point a menu is displayed indicating the available options to the user.
